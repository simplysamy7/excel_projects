# MS Excel Projects
This repository contains my Data Analysis projects done using MS Excel. I have used VLOOKUP functions, mathematical formula, filters, created Pivot Tables and pivot charts to clean, analyze data and draw insights.

**1.Sweetshop Data Analysis:**

Dataset: The dataset contained food details fields like food item names, prices. It also had data on regions, sales and delivery people details.

Analysis: Analysis was acrried out to find out the georgraphical distribution of sales, sales over time and high value customers who we need to target more.

Tools used: The cleanup and analysis and visualization was done on MS Excel. We used tools like pivot tables and pivot charts, mathematical functions; and finally created a dahsboard to present the findings.

**2.Bike Buyers Data Analysis**

Dataset: The dataset contained details on customer demographics of bike buyer like age, gender, income, education, profession, marital status, commute distance.

Analysis: It analyzed purchases based on gender, income and age; relationship between distnace and bike purchase.

Tools used: The cleanup and analysis and visualization was done on MS Excel. I used pivot tables, pivot charts, created dahsboard and inserted slicers in the dahsboard to make it more interactive.

**Pizza Shop Data Analysis**

Dataset: Data on orders, order details, pizzas, pizza types

Analysis: Fidning out the best selling pixxas, the peak hours of the day, seasonal trends in pizza sales throughtout the months in a year.

Tools, Formulae or Functions used: Filtering (Top 10 criteria), mathematical formulas like average, pivot tables and pivot charts.

**IMDB Movies Data Analysis**

Dataset: Contained details on film, genre, cast, director, duration.

Cleaning: Removal of duplicates, deltion of blanks and nulls, removing inconsistent punctuation in values.

Analysis: No. of movies in a year, most and least rated movies, most and least voted movies.

Tools, functions and Formulae used: Pivot tables, charts, filtering, mathematical functions like sum, average.

**Coffee Datset Analysis**

Datset: data on orders, customer details, order details, types of coffes, different coffe roast,, quantities sold.

Cleaning and Profiling: If-else statement, Vlookup functions, checking for duplicates, calculating sales by multiplying quantity with price.

Analysis: Sales over years according to coffee type, sales by country and product_id. Adding slicers of variables like roast type, size, order date.

Tools, functions and Formulae: Mathematical functions, slicers and pivot tables and pivot charts.
